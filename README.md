I'm Sylvia Hang, a filmmaker and visual storyteller based in New York City. My journey in film began during my college years, where I discovered my passion for capturing moments and telling compelling stories through the lens.

As a creator, I focus on projects that blend art and culture, from captivating short films to dynamic music videos and insightful documentaries. I believe in the power of visual storytelling to connect people and share unique perspectives on the world around us.

When I'm not behind the camera, I'm actively collaborating with other students and artists in NYC's vibrant creative community, constantly seeking new techniques and approaches to filmmaking.
